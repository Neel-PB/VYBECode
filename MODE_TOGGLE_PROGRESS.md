# VYBE Mode Toggle - Implementation Progress 🚀

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 1)

### 1. Mode Service Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `src/vs/workbench/services/mode/common/mode.ts` - Interface & types
- ✅ Created `src/vs/workbench/services/mode/browser/modeService.ts` - Implementation
- ✅ Created `src/vs/workbench/services/mode/browser/mode.contribution.ts` - Service registration
- ✅ Service persists mode selection to storage

### 2. Mode Bar Component
- ✅ Created `src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/modebar/modeBarPart.ts` - UI Component
- ✅ Created `src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/modebar/media/modebar.css` - Styling
- ✅ Toggle buttons: **IDE** and **VYBE**
- ✅ Project selector placeholder
- ✅ Search bar placeholder

### 3. Integration Points
- ✅ Added `MODEBAR_PART` to Parts enum in `layoutService.ts`
- ✅ Mode bar positioned below title bar (40px height)

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Phase 2)

### What's Being Compiled
Your watch process is compiling these new files right now! Once complete, the mode bar will appear.

## 📋 NEXT STEPS (Phase 3)

###Step 1: Import Mode Bar into Workbench
**File to modify:** `src/vs/workbench/browser/workbench.ts`

Need to:
1. Import `ModeBarPart` from `./parts/modebar/modeBarPart.js`
2. Import mode service contribution
3. Add mode bar to parts creation loop
4. Add to layout grid

### Step 2: Register with Layout Service
**File to modify:** `src/vs/workbench/browser/layout.ts`

Need to:
1. Add mode bar view reference
2. Include in grid layout
3. Position between title bar and editor

### Step 3: Test the Toggle
Once integrated:
1. Reload VYBE (`Cmd+R`)
2. See the mode bar appear below title bar
3. Click **IDE** / **VYBE** buttons
4. Watch mode switch (console.log for now)

## 🎯 PHASE 4: Vibe Mode Layout (After Basic Toggle Works)

Once the toggle is functional, we'll implement:

### Vibe Mode UI
1. **Chat Panel** (`src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/vibe/chatPanel.ts`)
   - AI conversation interface
   - Message history
   - Code generation

2. **Preview Panel** (`src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/vibe/previewPanel.ts`)
   - Live web preview
   - Hot reload
   - Console output

3. **Layout Switcher** (modify `layout.ts`)
   - Show/hide parts based on mode
   - Smooth transitions
   - State preservation

## 🔍 Current Status

**Watch Process:** ✅ Running (compiling new files)
**VYBE:** ✅ Running (ready for reload after compilation)
**Mode Service:** ✅ Created & Registered
**Mode Bar UI:** ✅ Created & Styled
**Integration:** ⏳ Next step

## 🚀 How to See It

After I complete the integration (next few steps):

1. **Wait for compilation** (watch will finish)
2. **Reload VYBE** (`Cmd+R`)
3. **Look below the title bar** - you'll see:
   ```
   [IDE ●] [VYBE]  |  Select Project ▼  |  🔍 Search
   ```
4. **Click buttons** - mode will switch!

## 💡 What Happens When You Switch Modes

### IDE Mode (Current Default)
- Traditional VS Code layout
- All features available
- Full file explorer
- Activity bar visible

### VYBE Mode (Coming in Phase 4)
- Chat panel appears
- Preview panel shows
- Minimal file tree
- AI-driven workflow

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Hot Reload Works**: After compilation, just `Cmd+R` to see changes
2. **State Persists**: Your mode choice is saved
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Traditional IDE mode works exactly as before
4. **Incremental**: We're building this step-by-step

## 🎨 Visual Design

The mode bar uses VYBE's color scheme:
- Dark background matching sidebar
- Purple accent for active button (from your icon)
- Rounded corners (modern look)
- Smooth transitions

**Ready for the next step?** I'll now integrate the mode bar into the workbench layout so you can see it! 🎵✨
